# Kitchen_Recipes
## Description 
This project I made while learning Unity from scratch 
(Until now, it's still a demo).<br> <br>
In this game, you can move, collide with the counters, and spawn food from each container by standing in front of it and pressing E. Also, you can cut the cheese, tomato, and cabbage into slices by putting cheese, tomato or cabbage on the cutting counter and pressing F. You can spawn a meat patty from its counter and cook it on the cooker, but be careful not to burn it. If you burn it by mistake, you can get rid of it in the trash bin. There is a plate counter that spawns a plate every 4 seconds, but you can not pick it up (I will fix this bug in the next version).
